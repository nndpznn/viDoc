## Introducing viDoc!

Targeting amateur videographers and filmmakers looking for a platform to organize their many ideas and keep track of projects, viDoc is designed to streamline the creative process, providing space to take notes, compose shotlists, and eventually, organize ideas visually on a graphic timeline.

### State of viDoc (updated 9/30)

As of Monday, 9/30, viDoc is still in early stages of development, not yet ready to present to a larger user base. The largest piece of the puzzle(and most unique part in my opinion), the drag-and-drop-style graphic timeline, has not yet been implemented. I am accepting feedback from those who decide to give it a try and will try and respond as best I can. I have implemented a mock-up timeline(not interactive yet) and am working on the Inkling feature as an easy way to tack notes and stray thoughts onto your projects.

### Ideation

As a hobbyist content creator myself, I've struggled to find a free resource to make video outlines to the level of complexity I desire. While notetaking apps are a workable alternative, their all-purpose nature prevents them from providing the exact support that videographers need.

### To-Dos

Some ideas of possible additions/changes to viDoc that are inconsideration.

- [High Priority] GRAPHIC TIMELINE with drag-and-drop functionality â€” Click a point on the timeline, add a note or drawing!
- [High Priority] INKLING feature to add small fragmented notes and ideas indiscriminately.
- SHOTLIST feature
- Thumbnail submit system
- "Mark as published/finished" button

### Tech Stack

- Not needing anything in particular except for a chance to practice my full-stack skills, I chose a very common tech stack, composed of TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Supabase, along with the MaterialUI library.
- The project is hosted by Vercel.

### Thanks/Credits

- I would like to extend my thanks to LMU Keck Lab Manager, [Masao Kitamura](https://github.com/masaok), for getting me started with Next.js and hooking up the initial Supabase connection, as well as providing general guidance and support. I would not know where to start without you!
- Thank you to [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja) on YouTube for tutorials on accessing Supabase through JS/React!
- I used ChatGPT to help me scrub through the Next.js documentation to find causes for runtime errors, explain some React and TypeScript concepts, and offer ways to improve the conciseness and organization of my code. I never used it to copy/paste source code or implement a solution without my guidance or understanding.
