## Introducing viDoc!

Targeting amateur videographers and filmmakers looking for a platform to organize their many ideas and keep track of projects, viDoc is designed to streamline the creative process, providing space to take notes, compose shotlists, and eventually, organize ideas visually on a graphic timeline.

### State of viDoc (updated 9/9)

As of Monday, 9/9, viDoc is still in early stages of development, not yet ready to present to a larger user base. The largest piece of the puzzle(and most unique part in my opinion), the drag-and-drop-style graphic timeline, has not yet been implemented. I am accepting feedback from those who decide to give it a try and will try and respond as best I can.

### Ideation

As a hobbyist content creator myself, I've struggled to find a free resource to make video outlines to the level of complexity I desire. While notetaking apps are a workable alternative, their all-purpose nature prevents them from providing the exact support that videographers need.

### To-Dos

Some ideas of possible additions/changes to viDoc that are inconsideration.

- [High Priority] GRAPHIC TIMELINE with drag-and-drop functionality.
- [High Priority] STICKY NOTE/INKLING feature to add small fragmented notes and ideas indiscriminately.
- SHOTLIST feature
- Thumbnail submit system
- "Mark as published/finished" button

### Tech Stack

- Not needing anything in particular except for a chance to practice my full-stack skills, I chose a very common tech stack, composed of TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Supabase.
- The project is hosted by Vercel and makes use of the MUI MaterialUI library.

### Thanks/Credits

- I would like to extend my thanks to LMU Keck Lab Manager, [MasaoKitamura](https://github.com/masaok), for getting me started with Next.js and hooking up the initial Supabase connection, as well as providing general guidance and support. I would not know where to start without you!
- Thank you to [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja) on YouTube for tutorials on accessing Supabase through JS/React!
- Thank you to ChatGPT for helping me scrub through the Next.js documentation to find causes for runtime errors, explain some React and TypeScript concepts to me, and improve the conciseness of my code.
